          <h2>It's a Start...</h2>
          <p>In uncertain times, uncertainty is a certainty. The circumstances that we all find ourselves in are alarming, unprecedented, and yet still somehow not all that surprising. It also doesn't take a genius to figure out things will get worse before they get better. However, life will be had in the smaller things in life, things that we enjoy; mine just happen to be guitars and computers. To me, both of these things serve a very similar purpose, however each in a completely different way. Both computing and playing the guitar are an extension of the self, wether it be to express ones thoughts, or to solve a problem in a way that the mind itself cannot accomplish. Which will mercifully lead to my point. This piece of personal real estate is where I will host my thoughts/editorials on things that intrigue me, which will 95% be related to guitars or computer stuff. The future is uncertian, however it's certain that I'll be hanging around here.</p>
